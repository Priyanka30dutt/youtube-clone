    <!-- CSS Specifiity is that selector which is more specific has more priority 
    than those selector which are less specific,for eg we have "p" and "video-stats",
    "video-author","video-description" and etc selector but most specifc one are the
    classes name,that's why we can see,although we have set margin-bottom: 0px;
    in p selector,but margin-bottom: 20px; in class slector will have more priority
    and thus will beimplemented -->

    <!-- CSS have many text element which is used to modify certain part of text.
    eg:-<u> for underline</u>,<strong>for bold</strong>,
    <span>it let us modify specific part of text without affecting the whole 
    thing and we can style it however we want,it doesn't come with its own
    default style</span>
    You can give classes to these text element -->
